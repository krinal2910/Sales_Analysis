# Sales Data Explorer ðŸš€

Welcome to the Sales Analysis project! I am here to uncover the story behind a year's worth of sales data, using Python magic. Let's make data fun! ðŸ“Šâœ¨

**What's Inside?**

Explore 12 months of sales data neatly packed in a CSV file. I am using Python's Pandas for smart data tricks and Matplotlib for showing off my findings in cool charts.

Before You Begin

**Make sure you have:**

- The latest Python and Pandas installed.
- A little know-how about playing with data.
- Heard of Matplotlib? That's our visual storyteller.

**Get Started**

 Clone the treasure - git clone https://github.com/krinal2910/sales-analysis.git

install Python tools - pip install pandas matplotlib

**How It Works**

I kick off by bringing the sales data into our Python playground. Then, we clean it up, removing any weird stuff. New columns like 'Month', 'Sales', and 'City' are born!

**Now, the exciting part - answering business questions:**

What month was the sales superstar?
Which city rocked the sales chart?
When should we shout about our products?
What products are BFFs in sales?
Which product takes the sales crown and why?

Answers come to life in colourful charts and graphs!

**Tech Magic Used**

Python 3.9
Pandas Library
Matplotlib Library
